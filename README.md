1. In value insertion to the array, how many times did your code create a new array?
                          
       12 times

3. In value insertion to the array, how many array elements are left unused after the very last insertion? This is the memory cost of using arrays.

       There are 84269 unused elements left.

5. When is it useful to store data in arrays vs linked lists?

       Array: When we already have given a fixed size then array will be useful, as it easier to manipulate the array by using index.
       Linked List: When we need to deal with dynamic size, and also linked list it easier to delete a node without affecting the whole list
